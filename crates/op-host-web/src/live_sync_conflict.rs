/// The safety decision behind [`maybe_auto_resolve_conflict_in_session`],

///
/// Two situations qualify, for the same underlying reason — there is an
/// authoritative document to accept, so accepting it converges rather than
/// destroys:
///
/// 1. **A live collaboration session** (`Active`). The session core sequences
///    every edit, and a rejected local edit is projected into
///    `collab.discarded_edit` for the panel to replay.
///
/// 2. **A server-authoritative deployment** (`serveMode: online`). The daemon
///    owns the one in-memory document every writer reaches, and its version
///    counter is the total order. A 409 there means only "someone else's push
///    landed between this tab's read and its write" — and the SSE stream is
///    already delivering that newer document, so re-reading it is not a
///    choice between two candidate truths, it is catching up to the one.
///
/// Why overwriting is acceptable in case 2: the lost window is a single
/// push's diff — at most the ~2 s since this tab last synced — and the
/// alternative is the latch, which in a shared tenant never clears, because
/// nothing outside a session ever resolves it. A visitor would simply be
/// frozen out of the document. Demo-grade concurrency (409 → refetch) is the
/// documented semantic for a shared online tenant; a latch that requires a
/// session to lift is not a stricter version of that, it is a hang.
///
/// IDS Studio embeds also share one room-scoped daemon document behind the
/// Gateway's authenticated room routing. They use the local server protocol,
/// not upstream online mode's separate account-tenant store. Treat that embed
/// as sequenced without changing host authentication or storage modes.

/// Outside those cases — a local or managed daemon with no session — the daemon is a
/// peer holding the operator's file, not an authority, and nothing preserves
